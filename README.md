# Online Payment Fraud Detection

## Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes:
- Applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance, along with preprocessing steps like scaling, label encoding, and outlier treatment.
- Developing fraud detection models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, and XGBoost, achieving 98% recall and 98% accuracy with the best model (XGBoost).
- Visualizing results using Power BI for better insights.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
